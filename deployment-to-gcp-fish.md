# Deployment to GCP using Fish Shell

## Prerequisites
Ensure you are using the Fish shell. If you are not in the Fish shell yet, switch into it by running:

```bash
fish
```

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Make the Script Executable (Optional)
This step is optional but helpful if you want to run the script directly later. Run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x deploy-gcp.fish
```

### 2. Run the Script
You can run the deployment script using:

```bash
fish deploy-gcp.fish
```

If the script is already executable and located in your current directory, you can run it directly with:

```bash
./deploy-gcp.fish
```
